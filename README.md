# Odin Project - Recipes

## Overview

Learning web development with The Odin Project.  This is the first project under Foundations.

### Tools / Technologies Used

- Terminal
    -- mkdir: Creating a new directory
    -- cd: Change directory (I happen to come across Zoxide through homebrew, which I can use "z" instead of "cd")
    -- touch: Creating a new file
    -- ls -F: Lists directory contents with the F flag denotes which are directories
    -- ls -la: Lists directory contents including hidden files/directories
- VS Code
- Git/Github
- HTML
